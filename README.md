## How to use

Download the Blender **.blend* file. There's no need to get the script as it is already included in the *.blend* file itself.

Don't worry, you can (and you need to) allow the execution of the script! If you're worried, the script is available here, you'll see it's safe.

Open the file, click on "Open Video..." on the UI panel on the right, and begin annotating using the annotation tool of Blender!

The *Export Video* button is available only if you have installed and activated [*DuBlast*](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/dublast/). Otherwise, to export your video with annotations, you will have to use the *Render viewport animation* from Blender.
